# Module 12: Plotly & Belly Button Biodiversity
## Plotly Belly Button Dashboard Challenge

## Background and Overview

Roza has a partially completed dashboard that she needs to finish. She has a completed panel for demographic information and now needs to visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, her volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

## Requirments

This new assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables.

- Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart
- Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
- Deliverable 3: Create a Gauge Chart
- Deliverable 4: Customize the Dashboard

## Resources

- JavaScript
- HTML
- Visual Studio Code
- Google Chrome 
- Comman Prompt

## Results

### See below screenshot of the dashbaord

The wesbite was created with a bar chart, bubble chart and gauge all interactive and dyanmic from the drop down menu which selects a specific patient number and shows the relvant demogrpahic information for the specific patient and all the graphs for them. When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940â€™s data is displayed in the dashboard.

### Customization option chosen
1. Add an image to the jumbotron. (added a blue DNA picture)
2. Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage. (Changed the color of the bar graph)
3. Use a custom font with contrast for the colors. (Changed title font to monospace and changed title bottom color to dark red)
4. Add information about what each graph visualizes, either under or next to each graph. (Added a bubble with chart descriptions and some emojis)
